Because you are my first friend ever.

-Misa. -Yes?

Then, could you ask Rem to k*ll L?

Rem...

I want Light to love me.

And I'm certain we could be happy together.

All right, then.

I'll k*ll L for you.

L will die and that's all it took?

When should I k*ll him?

Just take me to where he is and I'll k*ll him in an instant.

The sooner the better.

Tomorrow?

But we should think this through before we could decide on anything.

Let me sleep on it and I'll let you know once I figured out a plan to k*ll him.

All right.

Heed this, don't do anything unless you're ordered to do so.

No matter what!

Of course, you have my word, in this regard where L is concerned.

Misa, give me your cell phone number.

It's about time!

Will you give me yours too?

No, I can't give you mine.

Why not? We're dating, so I should have your number.

I've told you, I'm still placed under scrutiny by the police.

They have the authority and power to bug on specific phone conversations.

In that case, you can have this.

Just use one of my cell phones.

I ended up with three because I use them for different things.

That's brilliant.

-We'll be safe if I use your phone. -All right!

Expect a lot of love calls and text messages from me, okay?

No, I'll keep it off.

I'll be the one making calls and inform you the updates.

-When it's absolutely necessary. -What?

No way.

Then, when are you going to call?

Probably tomorrow.

Notwithstanding of whether to have L ex*cuted or not, I'll still call you.

What? Tomorrow?

It doesn't sound like a romantic call but we can talk about love after that.

Well, Misa. Let's call it a day.

Hey, come on. It's only 7 p.m.

The time for lovers has just begun, hasn't it?

We can have romantic dinner, stare up at the sky and right after that, the main event!

Misa.

That's it.

Go home for today.

All right.

Also, when you're talking with Rem outside, speak softly and make sure that no one's around.

That's what Ryuk and I do.

Roger.

Sorry for the intrusion.

Misa, come again tomorrow!

What's the reason behind that sudden kiss?

I need to keep Misa besotted with me.

I see.

What's important right now is to decide whether to k*ll L or not.

Ryuga's identity as L hasn't made public yet.

So, if Ryuga dies, everyone in the investigation team will be suspicious of me.

Therefore, I have to be prepared.

I see.

I thought you were having second thoughts because he said that you were his friend.

Friend?

I was just giving him what he wanted.

From the beginning, I've said that if he wants friendship, then that's what I'll give.

Ryuga is Light Yagami's superficial friend.

But L is Kira's enemy.

That's right, L is my enemy.

Since Ryuga has revealed that he's L, I must destroy him.

If I k*ll L with an accident, there won't be many who would suspect that I'm Kira.

Even with suspicion, there's no proof.

I can only speculate what will happen after L dies.

This is all a wager now.

Tomorrow will be L's...

No.

It'll be the day Ryuga or rather known as Ryuzaki dies.

Hair.

Snack crumbs.

Hair.

Mr. Yagami.

If I die within the next few days, your son is Kira.

Another hair.

What did you just say?

Exactly. What are you talking about?

I'll arrange for you to have ready access to Watari.

I'm counting on you.

Ryuzaki!

You said he was almost entirely cleared and now this?

How much do you suspect him?

Even I don't know how I truly feel.

This has never happened before.

If Kira and the Second Kira are working together right now, I'm in big trouble.

Given that, I might not be analyzing the situation calmly so I could be wrong.

Maybe, I consider him the suspect because there's nobody else.

But still...

If I happened to be k*lled soon, please assume that your son is Kira.

I have no choice but to make a sneak att*ck.

This is all a wager now.

That's not true.

I just know how to swim with the tide.

What's wrong?

Hey.

Light.

Hello.

Kiyomi, I need to talk with him alone. Can I see you later?

Okay, I guess.

You left her just like that?

Never mind that.

Didn't you say you were afraid to appear in public?

Are you okay here?

As long as you're not Kira, I shouldn't be worried.

The fact is, you're the only one on the outside who knows I'm L.

So, I've told everyone that if I die in the next few days, it's not that far of a stretch to assume that you're Kira.

Damn it.

You told me that you've missed having me around at school.

So, I came out for a change of pace.

As long as I'm safe, college is a fun place.

That's right. Without you around, intelligent conversation is hard to come by, so it gets boring.

That explains why you're with Kiyomi.

Well, I guess you can say that.

Is it really all right to k*ll him today?

Damn.

As soon as I decided I should k*ll him, he suddenly appears.

As if to deflect my aim.

To prevent me from k*lling him.

This is exactly what he wants.

Do you want to have some cake in the cafeteria?

Sure.

My next lecture was canceled.

That's great, then.

I wonder if they have shortcake?

Well, who knows.

Light! There you are!

I had a photo sh**t nearby so I thought it'd be nice to visit.

Misa? You idiot!

Is he a friend of yours?

He looks so unique and cool.

No. I've won!

Misa's able to see Ryuga's real name!

I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane. Pleased to meet you.

I'm Hideki Ryuga.

Hideki Ryuga?

Right, he has the same first name and last name as that idol.

Isn't that funny?

But, it's different from the name I'm seeing.

Ryuga.

Coming out in public today has backfired on you!

Why is he laughing?

What could this mean? Did he notice anything?

But if he's guessed that she's the Second Kira, he would not be laughing like that.

Light.

I envy you.

I've been a huge fan of yours since Eighteen's August issue.

Is that so? I'm so happy.

Hey, look at that girl. Isn't she Misa-Misa?

You're right. It's Misa-Misa!

-Misa-Misa? -The real one?

With this crowd, I should've guessed that I'd be discovered.

-I'm a huge fan of yours. -Keep up the good work.

Okay. Thank you. I'll do my best.

What's going on?

Hey! Who touched my butt?

How atrocious!

Taking advantage over the situation is unjustifiable.

I'll find the one responsible for this.

Ryuga! You're so funny!

-Let me touch her too. -Stupid!

I want to ask Misa L's real name as soon as possible, but these people are in the way.

Misa!

You should get moving. You don't want to be late again.

Right. Sorry, Yoshi.

-Let's go! -Okay.

That's good. Once Misa's out of here, I just have to give her a call and ask her for L's name.

See you after work, Light.

Now, then. Shall we go too, Light?

Yes.

Excuse me, but could you go on ahead? I need to use the washroom.

All right. See you.

This is the end.

It has been fun, L.

I'm glad that once I know your real name, I could k*ll you myself then.

Yes? Hello?

What do you mean, "Hello"?

This cell phone must have been dropped by someone in that commotion earlier.

Bastard. He stole it.

Hello?


Yes. That's Misa's cell phone.

I'll return it back to her.

Of course, I understand.

Ryuga.

You probably think you've won.

But Misa has another phone.

I'll just have to call that one.

It's my cell phone, this time.

Yes?

Yes. I see. It's done, then.

I understand.

I'm not sure how you'll take it, but there's something I should tell.

Misa Amane has been held under custody under suspicion of being the Second Kira.

How in hell did he find out about Misa?

I never thought he'd catch her this quickly.

On those tapes the Second Kira sent, there were hairs and fibers, among other material evidence, attached to the masking tape used to seal them.

We discovered matching samples in her room.

There'll be an uproar if the public knows our exact suspicion behind her arrest.

We'll let the public know that her arrest was due to her manager's drug charge.

The truth behind this will never prevail.

I was careless.

That video.

I should have destroyed all the evidence before they get their hand on them.

In the end, Ryuga chose to protect himself by being close to me instead of hiding.

He confronted this head-on.

This wager is my...

My...

My...

No!

Not yet.

The challenge has just begun, L.

Watari, has she said anything?

No, she hasn't said anything yet.

Get me a visual of her.

-Are you sure? -Yes, quickly.

Ryuzaki! What's the meaning of this?

I've apprehended her as the Second Kira. I believe this is necessary.

Indeed, the evidence found in her room would rationalize our speculation of her as the Second Kira, but...

Yes. There's no mistake.

What we need now is a confession.

Whether she knows Kira and if she can prove his true identity.

Also, how she ex*cuted her victims.

Watari. Take the proper precautions, but do whatever needs to be done to get her to confess.

Understood.

Mr. Yagami, I'm going to bring in Light to testify, as the prime suspect.

Please be prepared.

Ryuzaki, Misa's talking.

Give me visual and sound quickly!

She's finally talking after three days?

I can't take it anymore.

k*ll me.

k*ll me. Hurry up and k*ll me!

I guess it was too much for a young girl.

This has gone too far.

Misa Amane, can you hear me?

I can hear you.

I beg you.

Please k*ll me now.

Is this because you admit to being the Second Kira?

No. I don't know anything about the Second Kira!

This is too much for me.

I'd rather die!

Now, hurry! Just k*ll me!

You should be able to k*ll me now, right?

Misa, do you mean...

Yes, k*ll me.

You want me to k*ll you?

Yes, k*ll me.

Yes, I can't take it anymore. k*ll me.

If I k*ll you, I'll k*ll Light Yagami too.

After all, it's his fault.

No.

Just k*ll me.

Misa, seriously.

Why would you die for Light?

That's it! If you won't k*ll me...

Watari, stop her from biting her tongue!

Is it possible for these actions be imputed on Kira's manipulations?

Rem. What's the matter?

Light Yagami.

My offer to help Misa escape has been refused.

It must be because she knows it'll get you into trouble.

Besides, the police will then have proof of her power.

When the suffering broke her, she started asking me to k*ll her.

All of this is for your love which she longs so much.

No matter how much she asked, I couldn't bear to k*ll her.

I couldn't bring myself to do it.

There was only one way to save her from that suffering.

Forfeiting ownership of the Death Note.

Correct.

If she forfeited the ownership of her notebook all memories related to the Death Note will disappear.

Memories of murders she committed with it and the fact that you are Kira will be gone.

Your secret will be safe.

Also, Misa will no longer be able to see Ryuk or me.

SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER Misa.

You'll forget everything about Shinigamis.

It's all right.

The human you love is Light Yagami.

You can have my word, those emotions will remain.

So Misa, forfeit ownership of the Death Note.

And leave everything to Light Yagami.

Misa is no longer the owner of the Death Note.

You did well, Rem.

I was beginning to think that was the only way out.

If her memories of the Death Note are erased, then it's highly likely for them to release Misa.

Light Yagami, I proposed this to Misa because I knew this is the method you would have desired the most.

But, I do have one condition.

If you don't save Misa, I won't hesitate to k*ll you.

I understand, Rem.

I think I have a good idea of what L is going to do next.

I have a plan.

This is goodbye, Ryuk.

What?

TO BE CONTINUED

PREVIEW Yes.

I know I probably look pretty bad in here, but this useless pride...

I'll get rid of it!
