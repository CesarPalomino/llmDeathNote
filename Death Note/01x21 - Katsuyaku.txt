Didn't you say we'd have a meeting every other week?

Why has it become more frequent?

We don't have a choice.

According to Eraldo's report, Misa Amane might know Kira.

According to this report, Misa Amane was once locked up and interrogated by L.

That's where the problem starts.

According to the report, Misa Amane really idolizes Kira.

And Yoshida Productions tried to get Yotsuba to use Misa Amane as their spokesperson.

So, Eraldo has suggested that we use Misa Amane as our spokesperson and use the opportunity to ask her about L.

I think we can't accept this proposal too easily.

Why not?

I think this is a good idea.

No, what Takeshi means is it's Eraldo's job to find out L's real identity.

I don't think he should push the responsibility to us.

Our contract requires him to find out L's real identity.

Shouldn't we get Eraldo to join this meeting?

That's a possible solution.

Mr. Kida.

Didn't we agree that you should refrain from calling me?

Is there anything urgent?

Got it.

In that case, I have a good plan.

After the meeting, I have criminals to deal with at home.

Kira is really busy.

This is getting interesting.

Misa Amane was once the second Kira. I'm sure of that.

She was even caught by L.

Her release shows that she gave up her right to possess the notebook and lost her memory.

We can't give up on this.

I want to marry Misa Amane.

Money, status and a beautiful wife.

I'm sure I'll be the object of everyone's envy.

After we get married, I'll buy her an expensive insurance policy.

I didn't know he was such a jerk.

Rem, help me hide the notebook at the usual place.

This is all I can do for Misa at the moment.

Okay, let's start from the next part.

Ms. Amane, did you come to Tokyo to meet Kira?

-What? -Hey.

Misa.

I know it's a clich√©d reaction but try not to overreact.

But that was good acting.

Nonsense. Let's try this again.

Yes, Mr. Ryuzaki.

I'll kick you if you don't start taking this seriously.

Misa-Misa.

You're not smiling.

Kanzou, just call me Misa.

It's not suitable at all.

But this is an important mission to catch Kira.

Misa-Misa.

What's up, Kanzou?

This is not just an audition to be Yotsuba Group's spokesperson.

It's also part of our undercover investigation.

I don't need you to tell me that.

You have to be careful. Don't mess up.

Your character is a strong and athletic manager.

Yes, I'll try my best!

Let's go!

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Good morning!

I'm Misa-Misa's manager, Kanzou Mogi!

Hey, Mr. Takeshi, Mr. Shimura.

-Nice to meet you! -It's been a while.

Go for it, Misa-Misa!

-Mr. Mogi is pretty good. -I'll make arrangements for a celebration.

I'll be waiting for you.

This is really not suitable for me.

I think this is the first time we've met, Ms. Amane.

I'm John Wallace, a consultant for the marketing department.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

I'll just cut to the chase and be honest with you.

I think our decision to use you as our spokesperson is more or less final.

But before that, we need to confirm something.

What is it?

We conducted a few investigations.

Your parents were k*lled by robbers.

And you idolized Kira for k*lling the murderers.

Then, you came to Tokyo because you wanted to meet Kira.

Who told you that?

I won't reveal my source but the information is accurate.

Your expression just revealed it all.

I didn't know Eraldo had done such a thorough investigation.

Besides that, I think you're hiding something from us.

Something you don't want the public to know about.

This is where I should break out in cold sweat and take a pause.

You were once locked up by L.

Could you please tell us what happened?

We'd be in trouble if Yotsuba's spokesperson is Kira.

That's right. Please tell us the truth.

Okay.

I will tell you everything.

I was once locked up.

But I didn't know it was L.

He asked me a lot of questions about Kira.

But I'm not the second Kira.

He knew that I had nothing to do with Kira.

That was why he released me.

Did you see the face of the person who locked you up?

I was blindfolded.

But you heard his voice, didn't you?

He spoke through speakers.

Come on.

This is not an interview. It looks more like an interrogation.

How much longer will this be?

I'm going to the bathroom.

Exactly.

I think we're going off topic.

Excuse me.

Can I go to the bathroom as well?

I'm so stressed.

But it seems to be going pretty smoothly.

I have to keep it up.

She'll never regain her lost memory even if she touches this piece of paper.

But at least Misa will see me.

What's this?

A monster.

Misa.

The people of Yotsuba might k*ll you anytime now.

You're in great danger.

I've come to tell you this.

Calm down and listen to me.

Calm down?

I think the monster is more likely to k*ll me.

I'm on your side.

You're on my side?

Is Misa-Misa okay?

We should've wired her.

It is someone else indeed.

The Kira who was in detention before and the current Kira are definitely different.

The current Kira will judge anyone who's been reported to be a m*rder*r.

The previous Kira did not go after those who had no intention to k*ll, those who k*lled by accident and those who had mitigating circumstances.

If I was Kira, I think that's how I would judge them.

The previous Kira was a very good judge.

The ways we think are so similar that it's scary.

What the hell am I thinking?

I'm not Kira.

Why would I compare myself to Kira?

What's wrong with me?

Light Yagami is Kira.

What is Light doing now?

Who are you?

I know you're not a stalker but you don't look human.

Of course I don't.

I'm a Shinigami.

You and I used to work together.

What are you talking about? I don't understand anything you said.

Have we met before?

Light is Kira?

Death Note.

If you write someone's name in it, the person will definitely die.

Light Yagami used that notebook to judge criminals and became known as Kira.

Misa, you're the same as Kira.

No. You actually have a greater power than he does.

You used that power to get close to Kira, who is Light Yagami.

Light is Kira.

And I'm the second Kira?

Yes.

No. You were once the second Kira.

But I think the circumstances were part of Light's plan.

Then, was Ryuzaki right?

Misa.

Do you still love Light to death?

Mr. Shinigami, you truly are a god of death.

You know everything about me.

I believe everything you said.

I do love him to death.

If Light is Kira. I'm Kira too.

Both of us were once Kira.

This is great!

I believe you.

You haven't changed, have you?

I think your feelings for Light will never change.

Then I believe you'll find happiness in following Light Yagami and doing everything for him.

Thank you, Mr. Shinigami.

I'm Rem.

The current Kira is a despicable and useless person.

I don't know what he's capable of.

You have to be careful.

Also, be careful with the people of Yotsuba.

You have to believe Light and let him do whatever he wants to do.

I understand.

I just need to act normal, right?

That's right.

Go back to the interview.

You should be able to tell who Kira is.

You should be especially suspicious of him.

I'm sorry for the long bathroom break.

I have to touch up my makeup to make myself look pretty.

Listen. Once you go back into the interview room, the person sitting in front of me will be Kira.

Rem.

The person sitting in front of Rem is Kira.

Higuchi is Kira?

Damn.

Misa-Misa is taking such a long time.

She's back.

Hi, everyone!

I'm so tired.

How did it go?

Yotsuba has decided to use Ms. Amane in their commercials.

Really? That's great!

I gave them my phone number and email address.

Three of the seven men have texted me to ask me out.

What did you say?

I could just go on a date with them and investigate them.

Everything is going according to plan.

No, we have to cancel the plan.

Why? We've come this far.

This will put you in great danger.

I will not let you accept the commercial job.

You'll have to deny that you were suspected to be the second Kira and were locked up by L.

Mr. Mogi will ensure your safety.

You'll just play the role of an artist.


That's...

Since that's what Light wants me to do, I'll listen.

I'm tired.

I have a location sh**ting tomorrow. I'll go to bed now.

Light, thanks for your concern.

But I've thought of a great plan.

I'll definitely help you.

Light, do you want to spend the night with me?

What are you talking about, Misa?

I know.

We'll have to wait until Kira is caught, right?

Light, don't be shy.

Don't be shy, Light.

I'm not being shy.

Why are you taking it so seriously, Light?

Cut!

No problem.

Thanks!

-Thanks. -Thanks.

Misa-Misa, thank you so much.

I need to use the bathroom. Can I use the hospital's bathroom?

Yes.

Go!

TOYO WOMEN'S HOSPITAL Just wait for me here.

I'm here.

Thank you.

Mori, you look good in a nurse's uniform.

Really?

TOYO WOMEN'S HOSPITAL I've managed to sneak out.

Nice car!

If you like this car, I can drive you around anytime you want.

No. I'll buy you one.

Come to think of it, the nurse's uniform looks great on you.

Do you like it?

You sure took a long time.

-Where's Misa? -She's gone on a date.

Damn.

TOYO WOMEN'S HOSPITAL

Kyosuke Higuchi.

He wouldn't stop texting me since the last time we met.

This is the kind of man Kira is like.

How despicable!

Misa, shall we get something to eat?

You're not using that as an excuse to take me to some weird place, are you?

Well, even if you have any ulterior motive, I can k*ll people, so I'm not scared.

What is Misa thinking?

Did Light Yagami tell you to do that?

No, is Misa just trying to tell me that in case something happens, I should help her k*ll Kyosuke?

Misa, what you said was really interesting.

k*ll people?

Yes.

Because I am the second Kira.

What?

Even if this girl was the second Kira, I'm sure she's no longer the second Kira.

Besides, she has lost her memory.

What's going on?

Misa, you don't have to tell such a lie just because you want to be cautious.

Despite what you see, I'm a gentleman.

Well, I don't plan on showing you the proof that I'm the second Kira as I show it to Kira only.

You'll show it to only Kira?

What do you mean?

My dream is to be Kira's wife.

And I'm sure Kira needs me.

If she's the second Kira, what happened at Sakura TV showed that the second Kira has the Shinigami eyes.

If this was true, I have to keep her by my side no matter what.

Let me test her.

Well, I'm Kira.

Marry me then, Misa.

Really?

Yes.

Really.

What proof do you have? Show me the proof.

How can I do that?

I can't show others that I can k*ll, right?

Really?

I will also show the proof to someone only if I know that the person is Kira.

Well, this is getting us nowhere.

You should k*ll someone then.

I may very well be Kira.

Okay, but I k*ll only bad people.

I see. Bad people, you say?

Ginzo Kaneboshi.

President of a large loan company.

He's known for using cruel methods to get his debtors to pay their loans, including using their insurance benefits.

So?

Can you check immediately whether he's already dead?

I just need to make a phone call.

Okay, then turn around for a moment.

Misa.

You want me to k*ll Ginzo Kaneboshi to gain his trust, right?

Okay.

Ginzo Kaneboshi Okay, he's already dead.

This is Kyosuke from Yotsuba.

The president just collapsed and stopped breathing.

Can you please call back later?

Was I right?

The target d*ed immediately.

If she didn't have the power, she wouldn't have been able to do that.

Okay, I've decided.

If I'm Kira, would you marry me?

Why do you look so serious all of a sudden?

Because I'm Kira.

Then prove it to me.

I have to go home to k*ll someone.

I'm sure you understand.

That won't do.

You could be lying to me just to get me to go home with you.

What about this?

What about you stop punishing criminals?

I'm sure you can do that if you were Kira.

If you only do that when I tell you to, then I'll believe you.

Because the judging of criminals can only be done if Kira has the will to do so.

That makes sense. Good idea.

Got it. I'm really Kira.

To make you believe me, I'll stop punishing criminals.

When you've verified that I'm Kira, we'll get married.

So that's what happened.

Kyosuke is Kira.

Now we know who Kira is.

The murders that have been bothering Chief Yagami will end.

Misa-Misa, you're incredible.

TO BE CONTINUED

PREVIEW Suspend the judging of criminals.

I think that will do.

If I marry Misa Amane, the second Kira, I'll get to see through the Shinigami eyes.

Then I'll gain dominance over all of Yotsuba.
