NHN NINE O'CLOCK NEWS

Near, things have been smooth sailing.

-Everything is going like you expected. -Okay.

MATSUMOTO

T.

I just need to convey this to you.

I understand.

I have a message for you too.

Sure.

I have confirmed it already.

Message?

I really want to meet you soon.

She said she wants to meet.

This makes me jealous.

Great!

This is a sign of confirmation by Teru.

Now, we only have to wait for Near to propose for a meeting.

Near, I am going to win.

I know exactly what you are up to.

I am Gevanni.

Near, the notebook has been verified.

He did the same thing for the past three days.

He would write a page at midnight every day.

All the victims matched too.

We see nothing abnormal about Teru.

I see.

Let's take action then.

-This is Near. -There he is.

L.

Near, what's up?

Let's meet up.

What?

I have something that I need to show you regarding Kira's case.

Didn't you think that I was Kira?

You shouldn't let me see you then.

No.

But this is something important for you to see.

I can only show you this face to face.

All problems will be solved by then.

All right then.

I want to clear up the misunderstanding between us too.

Near is doing this to prove that Light Yagami is Kira.

If Light is really Kira, then Light is doing this to k*ll Near.

Is the moment finally here?

Let's decide on the details then.

Sure. Let me know whatever you need.

First, the agents from both sides have to be there.

It means that when we meet, everyone who is investigating Kira must be there.

All right.

No problem.

Like I said before, we have four people on my team.

These will be the members of the special investigation unit.

Mr. Mogi will come with us too.

As for Misa, she will be released right before we take off.

You can meet us after confirming that she has been released.

What do you think?

What should we do?

It's a deal, Near.

There are five people on my team.

Wait, no. Kanzou is with you.

There will be three people with me then.

I see.

Next will be the meeting location.

In the east-southern part of Black Pier, there is an abandoned warehouse.

It's called Yellow Box Warehouse.

I have already bought the place.

If you agree, then we shall proceed with this location.

Light Yagami, what do you think?

Now you can do the thing you've always wanted to do.

One more thing.

Please bring the notebook that is being kept by the investigation headquarters.

Why?

The reason is simple.

No one will take care of the notebook if everyone will be here.

I promise you.

I wouldn't take it.

I wouldn't even touch it.

I will trust you as long as Mr. Aizawa confirms that the notebook is the one you've been keeping.

I understand.

Please let someone apart from L bring the notebook.

It's because I believe that L is Kira.

I understand.

Let me appoint someone to bring the notebook.

-Is that okay for you? -Sure.

Now, we only have to discuss the time.

Timing is the most important aspect.

Teru conducts the punishment every day after midnight.

That is probably the advanced notice.

Think about it.

The meeting time is on the 28th, which is three days after today.

One o'clock in the afternoon. Is that okay?

One o'clock?

This is what I would have expected.

Near has already been monitoring Teru's schedule.

I understand.

Whenever it is, it's fine with us.

Let's meet at one o'clock in the afternoon three days later then.

Sure.

-Near. -Light Yagami.

-I know what you are up to. -I know what you are up to.

-I will definitely win. -I will definitely win.

Kiyomi, I am sorry.

I'm a bit busy today.

A bit busy?

Can't you stay until morning?

I'm sorry.

I've been so busy in the past few days.

What a shame.

I have given my instructions to both Teru and Kiyomi.

This will be my final command to k*ll Near.

I love you, Goddess Kiyomi.

-There's an att*ck! -Protect her!

Ms. Takada, are you okay?

I'm fine.

He is running away. Get him!

Ms. Takada, hurry! Hide in NHN!

No.

The areas including the building itself will be dangerous if an att*ck is happening here.

Mello.

It's better if you leave this place first.

Ms. Takada, get on.

Hurry!

Don't worry, Ms. Takada.

-Just get on and leave this place. -Okay.

Team A and team B, escort Ms. Takada's vehicle.

Other teams, pursue the vehicle that att*cked us just now.

This is great.

All clear.

Let her take vehicle number seven.

Wait, no way! Pursue Ms. Takada.

Darn it!

Stop it, you idiot.

How dare you! What if you hit her?

What are you doing?

One of the outlaws carried a lot of weapons.

The escort of Ms. Takada and the police force are sparing no effort to track them.

Crap, this is bad.

-Is it Near again? -What happened near NHN...

Near.

We'll meet in three days anyway.

-Why did you do that? -No casualties reported.

What is the meaning behind all this?

No, wait. This does not seem to be Near's style.

It is Near.

The cars are all gathered here now.

How many people are there?

Takada's escort.

Since when the Japanese are allowed to bring such huge r*fles?

I'm considered one of the criminals who kidnapped Goddess Takada.

I assume you have questions for me.

You will not sh**t me.

Idiot.

You will not say anything anyway.

Someone who defies Master Kira must die.

Light told me to be careful of this particular person.

Mello.

Mihael Keehl.

Take off all of your clothes. Put them in that box.

Quickly!

I will give you this blanket.

L, I'm not the one who kidnapped Kiyomi this time.

Is that the case?


Then, it must be Mello.

Indeed.

Let me be honest then.

The escort I sent to protect Kiyomi has confirmed that it was Mello who kidnapped her.

She got kidnapped even when an escort was present. My apologies.

Near.

Are you able to get a hold of Mello?

No, not yet.

Although I have the channel, it is impossible for him to reply to me now.

At least, give me the blanket before I take off my bra.

Fine.

The escort had to sh**t one of the criminals and continue to track down Ms. Takada.

Light, were you able to contact her?

No.

Her cell phone has been switched off.

I really need to get in touch with her, but I have no other choice than to wait.

This is the only way.

I need to do it.

Regarding the man who was sh*t, his identity is still unknown.

-When the police was trying to identify... -I can't believe that Matt was k*lled.

I am sorry.

-Light. -So it is possible...

Keep quiet, everyone.

UNKNOWN CALLER Hello?

Light.

-It's me. -Kiyomi.

Kiyomi, are you okay?

She used an unknown number to call me.

Does it mean that she escaped from Mello? Or...

Light.

Help.

Don't be afraid. Calm down and answer my questions.

Okay.

Give me your location first.

Do you know where you are now?

I don't know where I am.

I have been thrown into a container and it's locked from the outside.

Before we enter the highway, I saw a sign indicating the direction to Nagano.

We're should be near a building now.

Kiyomi, you are the spokesperson of Kira.

I told you that your life would be hindered, remember?

I do.

I've also told you what you should do when you are in danger.

Do you still remember?

I do.

I did what you told me.

-I've done it. -Did you?

I did it once he asked me to take off my clothes.

I did exactly what you told me.

I put my life in the highest priority.

I did everything.

Light. I did everything you told me to.

You have to help me.

Kiyomi.

You do know what to do next, don't you?

Try your best to execute the punishment.

I do know, -but, Light... -Can you do it?

Yes.

Shuuichi, Hideki.

Let's go.

Touta, please stay at the headquarters.

I understand.

It's me.

Try your best to send the punishment list to my address.

Okay. All right, I understand.

Since she was able to call me and asked for this means that she was able to k*ll her kidnappers.

So, the only thing that I'm certain of is that she can't make any moves.

Nakajima, I am going to the crime scene of this case now.

Okay.

I've found the location by using the tracking device.

I'm on the highway towards Karuizawa.

Karuizawa?

Darn it, it will take us more than 30 minutes.

We have to be quick.

We're dealing with Mello. We don't know what he's capable of.

Yes.

Well, Shuuichi and Hideki are too careless for taking both front seats.

This is boring.

This is...

Mello.

What is going on?

Kiyomi Takada, committed su1c1de on January 26, 2013, at 2:32 p.m.

Using what she had in hand to burn what she wrote, then burn herself to death.

TO BE CONTINUED

PREVIEW This is over.

No. Everything will start all over again from today.

Kira's perfect world.

Everyone who knows about this notebook must die.
