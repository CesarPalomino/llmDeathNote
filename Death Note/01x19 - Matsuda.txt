Matsuda, this is not child's play. Don't take it so lightly.

Okay.

This is the Kira m*rder case. Can you be more serious?

I'm sorry.

-Matsuda. -No, Mr. Matsuda, please don't do this.

-Matsuda. -I don't want to be a burden to everyone.

Ryuzaki.

Is there nothing I can do besides being a manager?

-Then get me another cup of coffee. -What?

I really love you.

So, please don't go back.

Please stay with me forever.

Wait, sir!

I have a boyfriend. I hope you won't make me act in a love scene.

How can you say something like that now?

We can just pretend to kiss.

What? Then we won't be able to sh**t the film.

I said no and I mean it.

How could you do that?

The Tokyo headquarters of Yotsuba Group.

Today is Friday.

Almost all the deaths that would benefit Yotsuba Group happened on weekends.

I don't want to be a burden to everyone.

Mr. Mogi is incredible.

Matsuda, this is not child's play.

Can you be more serious?

-Mr. Matsuda is a little dumb. -Then get me another coffee.

Matsuda!

Where has Matsuda gone?

I don't know where he's gone.

What?

BADGE RETURN BOX

So let's look through this list for the time being.

Okay.

If I can k*ll someone just by having their face and name, will I use that to punish bad people?

The world would be better off if some people were dead.

But I don't think I will allow myself to become a k*ller just to change this society.

No, I'm overthinking.

It's impossible that I didn't remember anything

-if I had k*lled so many people... -What's wrong with you?

You've been staring at me.

Are you jealous that I'm enjoying the cake on my own?

-Not at all. -Here you go.

No, I don't envy you at all.

Ryuzaki.

What's up, Watari?

Someone asked Detective Eraldo Coil to find out L's true identity.

Speaking of Eraldo Coil, he's the second best after L, right?

Who got him to do the investigation?

The person is from the Tokyo headquarters of the Yotsuba Group.

Copyright Planning Director, Masahiko Kida.

So, it is the Yotsuba Group.

Yotsuba and Kira are connected.

If they're trying to find out L's true identity, that means they want to k*ll L, right?

That's bad.

We're already understaffed. Now we have to keep an eye on Eraldo.

Don't worry.

Because I am Eraldo Coil.

What?

The three greatest detectives in the world, L, Eraldo and Deneuve are all me.

People who try to find me usually fall for this.

This strawberry is for you. I hope you help me keep this secret.

Ryuzaki, you're incredible.

I should just sneak out with the crowd.

No, that would make my efforts to sneak in here pointless.

I'll wait until everyone's gone before I slowly search the building.

No, what if I get caught?

I should've gone back first.

Is it night already? It's really tiring.

At least it's the weekend.

I'd be depressed if this secret meeting with no end time is scheduled on a Monday.

A secret meeting?

Is this it?

Level 19.

Since I'm already here, I'll get to the bottom of this.

Okay, just get close to this guy, right?

Leave it to me.

So, I just have to damage the surveillance cameras security system at the Tokyo headquarters of the Yotsuba Group?

Yes.

I'm sure there's a connection between Yotsuba Group and Kira.

First, find out who has that kind of power at Yotsuba.

Then, how many of them are there.

We have to be very clear on these points.

We must never let Yotsuba know that we're investigating them.

If they find out, we'll never catch Kira. We should be aware of that.

Damn, I can't even hear clearly.

It'd be great if I can hear some keywords.

k*ll him and distribute his stocks among everyone.

I heard the word "k*ll" just now.

-Kira is really... -Kira?

I heard "Kira"!

What? Get Kira to k*ll him?

I heard that.

As expected, these people are connected to Kira.

Great, I just achieved something!

Who are you?

Please be patient. Don't do anything rash.

Don't just act according to your own judgment.

Ryuzaki.

Watari, what's up?

Mr. Matsuda has activated the distress signal on his belt.

-Where did it come from? -That's...

I think it's from the Tokyo headquarters of Yotsuba Group.

I'm a manager at Yoshida Productions.

My name is Taro Matsui.

This is our hottest star, Misa Amane.

I hope you'll get her to become your spokesperson.

What about getting her to act in your commercials?

-What? -Please forget what I just said.

I need to come up with a new strategy.

Matsuda, you idiot.

Taro Matsui of Yoshida Productions.

There's nothing suspicious about him.

And he doesn't seem to be a corporate spy.

Yes.

Then, I hope you will consider using Misa as your spokesperson.

These two are keeping an eye on me while the others are deciding on what to do with me in the meeting room.

Can I get out alive?

Has the distress signal been sent?

More importantly, will Ryuzaki save me?

What will happen to me?

You can answer that.

But you can't say where you are.

Hold the phone away from your ear, so we can listen to the conversation.

Okay.

Hello?

Hey, Taro.

It's Ryuzaki.

It's me, Asahi. It's been a while.

Hi, Asahi, it's been a while.

It sounds like you're outside.

-Are you at home? -Yes.

Are you alone, right now?

Yes, I'm alone.

What's up?

He's not with Misa Amane.

Matsuda is now alone.

-Yes. -Okay.

Do you want to go for a drink?

What? Now?

I'm sorry, I can't.

What's wrong with you?

Are you feeling the pinch again?

Pinch?

Yes, I am feeling the pinch.

You didn't have to tell me that.

Matsuda is in a pinch.

Okay then.

I'll call you another day then. Bye.

So, what about Misa?

I'm sure she'll help expand your company's business.

If you're trying to promote her, shouldn't you have brought her with you?

Are you really her manager?

She has a sh**ting just around the corner.

I'll ask her to get here once she's done.

Please consider using her as your spokesperson.

I just have to keep buying time.

Misa's phone went to voicemail.

I've left her a message to ask her to call us here.

What should we do, Ryuzaki?

Well...

If Mr. Matsuda dies, it'll confirm our suspicion about Yotsuba Group.

For now, let's just wait and see.

What should we do?

The question is whether he heard what we talked about.

There's a possibility he did. Let's just k*ll him.

What if he's really here to promote the actress?

Could he have been sent here by the police?

I think that's unlikely.

The Japanese police has stopped investigating the Kira case.

It doesn't matter who he is.

We have no choice but to k*ll him.

Well, he's right. It's good to have a brand ambassador.

Right?

She'll be done with her sh**ting soon.

Please wait.

I'm exhausted.

Oh! Light has left me a message.

It's already late. He is worried about me.

-Misa. -Light.

I'm sorry. I've been working the entire time.

I'm finally done.

Misa, aren't you with Matsuda?

He's such a loser.

He left. I don't know where he is.

My work phone is ringing.

It's a call from Matsuda.

Matsuda called Misa.

Ask her to allow us to listen to the conversation.

Okay.

Misa.

Once you're done with the sh**ting, come to the Tokyo headquarters of Yotsuba.

You might be featured in their commercial.

We're in the midst of a negotiation.

Really? That's great!


So you're meeting with a potential client?

I'll get there as soon as possible.

Good. Just take a cab and you'll be here soon.

Light, we may be able to save Mr. Matsuda.

But we'll need Misa's help.

I think she'll listen to you.

I'm Misa!

I don't do nude scenes, but I'm fine with swimsuits or underwear.

Thanks for your guidance.

I didn't think this girl would look so cute in person.

That's not the issue now, right?

Mr. Matsui, because it's Yotsuba Group, the company said that we should give them special treatment.

What? Special treatment?

Hi, everyone. Thanks for your guidance.

All the girls from the company are here to give you special treatment.

Hey, don't you think that we're heading to a weird direction?

We have no choice.

We can't let that manager go yet.

Since they're here, I'll enjoy myself.

Ryuzaki and the others can see this place.

Maybe they'll save me.

Come on, drink more!

I feel like I'm in heaven.

Misa is really good at this.

Now then...

I need to use the bathroom.

Ryuzaki, are you watching this?

Yes.

-I'm sorry, I... -Don't worry about it.

Okay.

Those eight people were having a meeting just now to get Kira to k*ll someone.

I heard them very clearly.

It's them. I'm very sure of that.

It's probably true.

But if you did overhear them, then they should be trying to k*ll you.

I know that.

Is there a way for you to save me?

It's good that you're still alive. Maybe we can save you.

But you have to die before you're k*lled.

What?

Okay, listen carefully.

What?

Don't tell me...

Why? That's ridiculous.

-Hey, Nagano... -In other words...

-That's how the aurora is formed. -I see.

-Our company will grow larger and larger. -I agree.

What's wrong?

I'm drunk.

I feel great!

Is everyone having fun?

Hey, have more fun!

Sorry to keep you waiting.

It's showtime for Taro Matsui!

What are you trying to do?

Go, Mr. Matsui!

Watch me.

Hey, you're drunk! That's very dangerous.

I'll be fine.

I can still walk in a straight line.

Flip!

-Don't do that. That's very dangerous. -Stop it!

Idiot!

I'll be fine.

He fell off!

Damn, this is bad.

I heard a thud and saw him on the ground. Damn!

-Call 911... -I hate playing this character.

Everyone, leave this to me. You guys should get out of here.

-How can we do that? -Don't worry about it.

I'm counting on you for the commercial!

Hurry up!

We'll be screwed if the media see us here.

Yes.

What happened? Did he commit su1c1de?

Well, it's good that we saw him die in front of our eyes.

-Hey. -Okay.

We're so understaffed that even I have to be a part of this.

This sucks.

Matsuda, you're an idiot.

"Misa Amane's manager has d*ed."

Hello?

Are you Masahiko Kida, the Copyright Planning Director of Yotsuba Group's Tokyo headquarters?

Yes. Who are you?

I'm Eraldo Coil.

I need to talk to you about the terms.

A deposit of two million dollars and another eight million dollars upon completion.

Are you serious?

Even if we decide not to go ahead with it, we have to pay two million dollars to buy his silence.

-What? -To buy his silence?

It looks like he knows a lot. That's why he's asked for money.

This doesn't look good.

I want to get out of this meeting.

I don't know who Kira is, but I don't want to get involved and get arrested.

Arayoshi.

You'll be dead tomorrow.

Hold on. I was just kidding.

I'll stay, I'll continue to be a part of this!

Then, what should we do now?

He still accepts the job despite what he knows.

He'll be on our side if we give him money.

That's all.

We have to get someone as smart as Eraldo to be on our side.

That's right. Let's pay him. No matter how much it costs.

That's right. Pay him.

Okay, sign this contract with Eraldo.

Any objections?

No.

L, are you listening?

I was so worried.

The security system here is really bad.

They only signed a contract with the security firm.

They don't even have a bug detector.

It's been a week since I sneaked into Yotsuba Group.

Somehow, I feel that everything is going smoothly.

It's about time.

One of the people here

is Kira.

Then let's start the meeting.

But there aren't eight of them. There are only seven.

TO BE CONTINUED

PREVIEW Ryuzaki.

Do you think I will become Kira, a m*rder*r, once I catch Kira?

Do I like that I'll do that?
