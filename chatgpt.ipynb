You're doing it out in the open.\\n\\nCould you tell me the date and time of the hijacking incident?\\n\\nIt was on December 20, in front of Asagao Hill.\\n\\nAt 11:02 a.m. On the way to Space Land.\\n\\nDecember 20.\\n\\nOn the way to Space Land, right?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nShoko Maki, su1c1de, January 1, 2007 Commits su1c1de, but nobody will bother and her body will not be found.\\n\\nDies by executing this plan within 48 hours.\\n\\nNow her body will never be found.\\n\\nEven if they do find her, they'll think that she committed su1c1de because of her fiancÃ©.\\n\\nWhat's so funny, Ryuk?\\n\\nI'm very sorry for questioning all of you individually.\\n\\nKira is not one of us.\\n\\nRyuzaki, what makes you think that Kira is not among us?\\n\\nTo be honest, I set some traps to check if you were Kira, but...\\n\\nI didn't feel the need to set them off on any of you.\\n\\nExcuse me.\\n\\nHe told us to switch off our cell phones!\\n\\nI got it.\\n\\nI'm almost done.\\n\\nEnter with your own key.\\n\\nWatari is coming.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nIf it's okay with you, I'll report this incident.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nI'd like to report it myself.\\n\\nAfter talking to you, I've decided to take immediate action.\\n\\nI suppose you're right.\\n\\nJust ten seconds to 1:15 p.m.\\n\\nI want to see how this woman dies, but I have to follow her secretly.\\n\\nNow, hurry to your death!\\n\\nKira will definitely be caught, right?\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nWhat's wrong? The time is already up.\\n\\nThat's weird.\\n\\nWhy won't she leave?\\n\\nMy tests have proved that I could k*ll them through su1c1de.\\n\\nThe criminals hanged themselves at the specified time.\\n\\nI've proved many times that I should be able to control her within these situations.\\n\\nSo why?\\n\\nRyuk.\\n\\nCome to think of it, he was laughing oddly when I used the Death Note.\\n\\nThat's not all.\\n\\nThe way he laughed when I asked for her name was also weird.\\n\\nIt happened every time her name was mentioned.\\n\\nAn alias!\\n\\nThank you all for your hard work.\\n\\nIs this Watari?\\n\\nWhere are your usual clothes?\\n\\nIf I dressed as usual, I would be giving away my identity as Watari.\\n\\nIt would also give away Ryuzaki's location in this hotel.\\n\\nI see.\\n\\nThe fact that I'm showing my face in front of you means you've won Ryuzaki's trust.\\n\\nI feel kind of honored.\\n\\nRyuzaki, I brought what you asked.\\n\\nGive them to everyone.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThese are everyone's new police IDs.\\n\\nNew?\\n\\nAn alias. That's it!\\n\\nRyuk can see her real name.\\n\\nThat's why he laughed.\\n\\nThis woman was being careful all along.\\n\\nThat's right.\\n\\nShe thinks Raye d*ed because he showed his ID.\\n\\nThat's why she's taking action without disclosing her identity.\\n\\nThis isn't good.\\n\\nIt's even harder to ask the real name of someone who has already given an alias.\\n\\nIf I keep asking her, she'll get suspicious.\\n\\nIt becomes more suspicious if I know that she was using an alias.\\n\\nI should be getting back soon.\\n\\nSomeone might be back at headquarters now.\\n\\nYes. I suppose you're right.\\n\\nHopefully, someone's already there.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nDamn it!\\n\\nStopping her would also be unnatural.\\n\\nWhat should I do? At this rate...\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nIf my dad calls, I promised her that I'd let her speak with him!\\n\\nIt's all over if he calls!\\n\\nWhat do I do?\\n\\nWhat am I thinking about?\\n\\nI can just switch off my cell phone.\\n\\nCalm down.\\n\\nI just have to find out her actual name.\\n\\nThere's got to be a driver's license or some sort of personal ID in her purse, pocket or somewhere.\\n\\nShe's a woman.\\n\\nIf things become desperate, I can use force.\\n\\nThat's stupid!\\n\\nI can't make a scene in a place like this.\\n\\nShe has to go to an isolated area.\\n\\nWhere? How should I talk my way out of this?\\n\\nShe is too cautious.\\n\\nNo, I need to change my plan of att*ck.\\n\\nI can do this.\\n\\nI can get her name without setting any alarms off.\\n\\nLight.\\n\\nWe can always do the eye deal.\\n\\nIt's just the same as wearing contact lenses.\\n\\nI'll get it done in a few seconds.\\n\\nI won't cut my life short just because of this woman.\\n\\nNo, I won't ever consider the deal!\\n\\nDon't bother me.\\n\\nShut up, Shinigami!\\n\\n-Excuse me. -Yes?\\n\\nDo you still have other matters at the police department?\\n\\nI'll be okay on my own.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nOur names and ranks are all fake.\\n\\nFake police IDs?\\n\\nKira needs a name and a face to k*ll.\\n\\nWe are challenging Kira with this idea.\\n\\nThis is only natural.\\n\\nBut an officer with a fake ID is...\\n\\nNo, if Kira needs a name to k*ll, an alias would help us protect our lives.\\n\\nWe should carry these around.\\n\\n-I think so too. -Yes.\\n\\nWhen you're giving out your name to some stranger, use the alias in your IDs.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nPlease be careful not to take them out within the police headquarters.\\n\\nIt could cause problems.\\n\\nUnderstood.\\n\\nWell then, everyone has to wear these belts.\\n\\nBelts?\\n\\nThese belts have a tracking device in the buckle.\\n\\nThis way, Ryuzaki will know your whereabouts.\\n\\nWhen you press the buckle twice,\\n\\nmy cell phone will ring.\\n\\nI'll call you back immediately.\\n\\nIn the morning, you will go to work as usual.\\n\\nUsing this method later, I shall confirm our hotel and room number.\\n\\nPlease use this for emergencies as well.\\n\\nThis is kind of cool. Like a special task force to capture Kira!\\n\\nTouta!\\n\\nThis isn't child's play.\\n\\nDon't joke around.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nThanks to you, I have gained confidence in my theory.\\n\\nDon't mention it.\\n\\nSince Ryuk started talking about the eye bargain, she is definitely using an alias.\\n\\nAt this rate, with her theory that Kira was on the bus and the information of the people Raye Penber was investigating, the police will immediately suspect me.\\n\\nHey, she's leaving. Is that okay?\\n\\nIt should take about five minutes for her to reach the headquarters.\\n\\nThink...\\n\\nHow can I get her name within five minutes?\\n\\nShe is going to the police headquarters.\\n\\nIf someone from the task force has returned, I'm finished.\\n\\nSomehow, I've got to find out her real name and k*ll her.\\n\\nThree minutes left until she reaches the police headquarters.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nWhat will you do?\\n\\n-Excuse me. -Yes?\\n\\nI haven't told you about something.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIt's impossible to reach anyone in the headquarters directly.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nI need to have this conversation naturally and connect it to something that she'll latch onto.\\n\\nI'll draw out her name later on.\\n\\nI can do this.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nThere's no one at the headquarters. Don't you think that's weird?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI thought it was strange, but...\\n\\nThe team of investigators is structured, so no one knows who is involved.\\n\\nIf people found out that the team is structured, an incident that happened to your fiancÃ© may occur again.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nThat's why you were told that the headquarters was empty.\\n\\nIn other words, you will never be allowed to consult someone from the headquarters.\\n\\nThat's a smart move. As expected of you, Light.\\n\\nWhy do you know so much?\\n\\nShe's pretty sharp.\\n\\nI guess I have no choice. I should tell you.\\n\\nIt's because I'm a detective from the task force.\\n\\nYou're a detective from the task force?\\n\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI'm actually in charge of the task force.\\n\\nYes. That's what I thought.\\n\\nI was troubled because the headquarters was understaffed.\\n\\nA lot of them quit because they're afraid of Kira.\\n\\nI'm just a high school student, but I helped the police solve two cases in the past.\\n\\nSo he was sold by that?\\n\\nI can go to the headquarters whenever I want to and I can investigate on my own.\\n\\nBasically, the people at the headquarters are the chosen few who can be trusted and whose abilities are reliable.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nBut I think I'll just drop by the headquarters anyway.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nPlease wait!\\n\\nI just told you that you can't speak with anyone.\\n\\nI would like to talk directly to L.\\n\\nCome to think of it, who is at the headquarters now?\\n\\nThere's no one.\\n\\nThat's not good.\\n\\nOne person should at least be there at all times.\\n\\nUnderstood.\\n\\nShuuichi, could you stay there for today?\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI can get there quickly from here.\\n\\nMs. Maki, please wait.\\n\\nIt's impossible to meet L.\\n\\nIt's useless.\\n\\nMaybe he could allow me to meet him.\\n\\nI only followed his orders from a computer screen, but two years ago in America, I used to work on a case under L.\\n\\nYou worked under L?\\n\\nI was an FBI agent until three months ago.\\n\\nThis is it.
